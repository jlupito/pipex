# pipex

  Pipex project for school 42

This project from 42 common core is the first introduction to concurrent programming.
The idea is to simulate the use of a "|" by using fork and getting familiar with 
parent/children processes to execute the commands.
File redirections (in / out) are also implemented in this project.

How to execute the program:
```
$> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
```
